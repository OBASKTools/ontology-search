# OBASK tools ontology-search

Ontology search APIs for OBASKTools.  API calls support autosuggest queries optimised for ontology search, as well as filtering and boosting of content using semantic tags.  

WARNING: OBASK tools originated with work carried out to support the [Virtual Fly Brain](virtualflybrain.org) project, the [Allen Cell-Type Knowledge Explorer](https://knowledge.brain-map.org/celltypes) and the [Cell Annotation Platform](celltype.info). Work to split this out into OBASK tools is currently ongoing and so code on this repo should be considered Alpha and may be subject to breaking changes
